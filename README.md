### Heya!

I was formerly the founding engineer @ [Kiki.club](https://kiki.club), and I'm now building a digital planning tool for creatives @ [BlockFlow](https://blockflow.so)! 

I also maintain a few open source projects: 
* [`react-dialog-async`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dialog-async)
* [`lucide-mui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lucide-mui)

Occasionally [I write articles](https://medium.com/@a16n.dev) about startups and interesting tech things I come across
